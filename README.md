**Ethical Considerations**

While Just4Fans champions a platform for friendly competition and community building, we strongly advocate for responsible online conduct. Here are some key guidelines to keep in mind:

* **Constructive Criticism:** When addressing gameplay issues, focus on providing helpful feedback without resorting to personal attacks or harassment.
* **Respectful Community:** We strive to maintain a safe and inclusive space for all gamers. Hate speech, bullying, and discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated.

**The "Cheaters" Section: A Platform for Awareness**

The "Cheaters" section serves as a tool for raising awareness about cheating in online gaming. By sharing verified evidence of cheating, the community can collectively work towards a fairer gaming environment. However, we emphasize the importance of adhering to the following principles:

* **Evidence-Based:** Only post verifiable videos or screenshots that clearly demonstrate cheating behavior. Unfounded accusations or misleading content will be removed.
* **Focus on the Act, Not the Individual:** The intent is to expose the cheating tactic, not to publicly shame or harass the player involved. Anonymize player names or avatars when possible.
* **Promote Reporting:** Encourage viewers to report cheating incidents to the appropriate game developers or authorities.
